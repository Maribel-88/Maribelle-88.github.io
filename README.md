## Maribelle Garden Set
 A website project created to showcase what I have learnt so far from course modules.
 This dynamic website is composed of eight pages , the Home page, About, Contact, Deals, Refund, Terms, Order Status  and the Cart/basket page.
 In all the pages there are buttons that customers can click in order to go the the desired page. This website is built with customer in mind.
 I am looking for the web visitors to be able to view my products and be able to instantly placed there order. Phones numbers and email of the owner 
 is available for easy reached and to be able to process their order quicker or even to follow-up the orders.

 ### Home Page 
 In the home page , I have implemented some bootstrap , HTML , CSS and small bit of Javascript in order to
 make the page more interactive and user friendly. Bootstrap icons made  the web page more engaging.
 I have showcase the products in the home page. I use CSS to design the box/grid where  I placed the items or product.
 I used some Javascript code in order to add items to the cart. The footer in the web page is simply done with HTML code.
 In this page , customer will view all the available products and prices. They will be able to add to cart their desired items 
 by clicking the plus icon  and minus icon to reduce the quantity or even delete the items from the cart.

 ### Cart Page
 This page is created with some CSS to style the grid and some Bootstrap icons to make it more intersting.
 Also some Javescript to let the user delete some items they don't want in their basket. When customer has chosen a product from home page it will
 be added to the cart. From here, the customer will be able to see all their chosen items and be able to add or reduce the quantity by clicking the 
 add and minus icons.Furtheremore, on the top of the page is showing the total price of their order. Also there is clear button option which give
 them the option to clear the cart.

### Contact Page
I used a form to collect basic information from the user which will be use to contact them regarding their query.
Customer will be able to leave the personal contact information and message. After completing the form, customer must send it by clicking the submit button. 
Once submitted the owner will receive the copy of their query through an email.
